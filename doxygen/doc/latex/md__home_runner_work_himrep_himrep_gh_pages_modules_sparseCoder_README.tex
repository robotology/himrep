This module needs the \href{https://github.com/pitzer/SiftGPU}{\texttt{ Sift\+GPU}} library. Since instructions on how to compile the library are platform-\/dependent, we do not provide intallation support here. However, if you need assistance, do not hesitate to ask by creating a dedicated issue.\hypertarget{md__home_runner_work_himrep_himrep_gh_pages_modules_sparseCoder_README_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysubsection{Compilation}\label{md__home_runner_work_himrep_himrep_gh_pages_modules_sparseCoder_README_autotoc_md34}
Once the library has been built as explained above, you can compile this module just by setting the {\ttfamily BUILD\+\_\+sparse\+Coder} flag to {\ttfamily ON} as explained \href{https://www.github.com/robotology/himrep\#compilation}{\texttt{ here}}.
